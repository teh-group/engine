## What is teh?

NPM is a mess? Too many frameworks? Dependency hell? Bloated packages folders? Can't keep up with the ecosystem? Pattern hell? Too many APIs? Too much configuration?

Don't worry, you have **☕ Teh**. It's a JavaScript alternative<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>, based on ES3, back when writing scripts, not bloated apps for html pages was exciting. Teh is aimed for simplicity and ease of use for the common person. Teh is not compatible with JS and it's ecosystem by design, that means ~~most~~ all of the JS libraries, frameworks and scripts will break, unless ported as Teh modules.

**But how does Teh compare to JS?** [Here's a slightly out of date list](https://rentry.co/3rafi).
